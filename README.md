# Hundo-Ent-Challenge
This was a challenge started by our very own Johnny Hundo, that we're creating into a project


## Design Approach
The framework I decided to use was <u>[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)</u>; a cross platform framework to create apps for iOS, Android, Web, Linux, & Windows environments. 

<u>Why Flutter:</u>    
   1. Very simple to implement Google's Material design (_Android App Aesthetic_) 
   2. Should the tool have an increase in demand, migration to other platforms will be quick
   3. Simple implementation of nodejs backend code should storage be necessary in the future
   4. Very flexible for quick UI elements for easily adjustable aesthetic

   > NOTE : Spill was developed using the Flutter framework, & Flutter was created by Google.
